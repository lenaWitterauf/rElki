R API to Java Data Mining Framework ELKI (https://elki-project.github.io/)

## Summary
The goal of this project is to offer an R interface to the Java data mining framework ELKI. ELKI provides a large collection of highly parameterizable algorithms, with an emphasis on unsupervised methods in cluster analysis and outlier detection. For more information on ELKI, see [here](https://elki-project.github.io/). This repository contains the ELKI jar [version 0.75](https://elki-project.github.io/releases/release_notes_0.7.5). If using this repository for research, please cite ELKI as explained [here]
(https://elki-project.github.io/publications) to give credit.

Currently, this interface implements twelve algorithms from the area of outlier detection. In case there's interest in using more of ELKI's algorithms from R, feel free to reach out!
